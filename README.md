ABOUT FORMULA 1

Formula One  is the highest class of international auto racing for single-seater formula racing cars sanctioned by the Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA). 

The World Drivers' Championship, which became the FIA Formula One World Championship in 1981, has been one of the premier forms of racing around the world since its inaugural season in 1950. 

A Formula One season consists of a series of races, known as Grands Prix (French for 'grand prizes' or 'great prizes'), which take place worldwide on purpose-built circuits and closed public roads.

Formula One cars are the fastest regulated road-course racing cars in the world, owing to very high cornering speeds achieved through the generation of large amounts of aerodynamic downforce.

The cars underwent major changes in 2017, allowing wider front and rear wings, and wider tyres, resulting in peak cornering forces near 6.5 lateral g and top speeds of up to over 325 km/h (200 mph).

As of 2021, the hybrid engines are limited in performance to a maximum of 15,000 rpm; the cars are very dependent on electronics and aerodynamics, suspension and tyres. 
 
Traction control, launch control, and automatic shifting, plus other electronic driving aids, were first banned in 1994, reintroduced in 2001, and have more recently been banned since 2004 and 2008, respectively.







Practice sessions

Before the race the drivers will have practice sessions on friday and saturday which helps them to adapt the conditions and make a proper setup for the cars.

The team mainly focuses on the data they get from these practice session to get an idea about the race.
for example: they look how their cars perform on high fuel runs and tyre degredation

There will be 2 practice sessions on friday and 1 on saturday.






Qualifying

For much of the sport's history, qualifying sessions differed little from practice sessions drivers would have one or more sessions in which to set their fastest time, with the grid order determined by each driver's best single lap, with the fastest on pole position. 

there will be 3 sessions in qualifying were the slowest 5 drivers will get knocked out after each session.

for ex:if the driver's lap time places him 15 he will start the race from grid no.15.




THE RACE

Basically the drivers just drive round and round around the circuit after everyround they complete a lap.

During the race the tyres often wear and loose grip pretty fast so the drivers used to pit for new tyres.
they pit once twice or thrice depending on the circuit and asphalt.

The first 3 drivers who complete the race will get to stand on the podium where they would be awarded with a champagne and trophy

Points are awarded to drivers and teams based on where they finish in a race. The winner receives 25 points, the second-place finisher 18 points, with 15, 12, 10, 8, 6, 4, 2 and 1 points for positions 3 through 10, respectively.

The driver with the most point on the final race wins the world championship
the team with the most ponts on the final race wins the constructor chapionship






Safety Car

In the event of an incident that risks the safety of competitors or trackside race marshals, race officials may choose to deploy the safety car. This in effect suspends the race, with drivers following the safety car around the track at its speed in race order, with overtaking not permitted. Cars which have been lapped may, during the safety car period and depending on circumstances permitted by the race director, be allowed to un-lap themselves in order to ensure a smoother restart and to avoid blue flags being immediately thrown upon the resumption of the race with many of the cars in very close proximity to each other. The safety car circulates until the danger is cleared; after it comes in, the race restarts with a "rolling start". Pit stops are permitted under the safety car.
